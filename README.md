# BiSK-Net: Boundary-Integrated Spatial-Kernel Network for High-Precision Polyp Segmentation

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of **BiSK-Net**, a hybrid Transformer–CNN architecture designed for high-precision polyp segmentation.  
BiSK-Net integrates **multi-scale kernel interactions**, **enhanced spatial-domain fusion**, and **explicit boundary supervision** to achieve accurate and anatomically coherent segmentation across diverse colonoscopy datasets.

##  Overview

BiSK-Net addresses three long-standing challenges in automated polyp segmentation:

- **Large variation in polyp scale and morphology**
- **Weak or ambiguous boundaries**
- **Need for both global semantic context and fine spatial detail**

To tackle these issues, BiSK-Net introduces three lightweight yet effective components:

1. **Multi-scale Kernel Interaction (MKI) Bottleneck**  
   Aggregates spatial information using parallel depthwise convolutions and feature-adaptive gating.

2. **Enhanced Spatial-Domain Interaction (eSDI) Module**  
   Improves semantic–spatial alignment using SE-based recalibration.

3. **Boundary-Aware Supervision**  
   Encourages sharper and more structurally consistent predictions using Sobel-derived boundary maps.
